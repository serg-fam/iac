IaC

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques, such as version control and continuous integration. This approach enables DevOps teams to automatically manage and provision technology stacks through code, rather than using manual processes.

Key benefits of IaC:
- Version Control: Track changes and maintain history
- Consistency: Eliminate configuration drift
- Automation: Reduce manual errors and save time
- Scalability: Easily replicate infrastructure
- Documentation: Code serves as documentation

Common IaC tools:
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation
- Azure Resource Manager
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Ansible
- Puppet
- Chef

This repository contains IaC templates and configurations for testing purposes.
